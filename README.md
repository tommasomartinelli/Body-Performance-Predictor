# Body-Performance-Predicton

Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Model Training using XGBoost

## Overview

This project is aimed at analyzing and exploring the physical performance data and training a classification model using XGBoost algorithm to classify the physical performance of individuals. The trained model is then used in the project (https://github.com/plspeziali/VNCCProject).

The project includes a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation using XGBoost.

## Requirements

The project requires the following libraries to be installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

These libraries can be easily installed using pip.

## Usage

The Jupyter notebook contains step-by-step instructions for data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation. Simply run the notebook cells in sequence to reproduce the results.

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in the `data` directory. The dataset contains physical performance data of individuals. It includes various features such as age, weight, height, and various physical performance metrics.

## Model

The XGBoost algorithm was used to train a classification model to classify the physical performance of individuals. The trained model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set.

The trained model is saved as `model.pickle` in the project directory. The saved model can be used to make predictions on new data.

## Credits

This project was created by [Tommaso Martinelli](https://github.com/tommasomartinelli) and [Paolo Speziali](https://github.com/plspeziali) as part of [https://github.com/plspeziali/VNCCProject]. The physical performance dataset was sourced from [Source of data]. The XGBoost algorithm was implemented using the [XGBoost library](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
